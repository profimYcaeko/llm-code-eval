The film is a celebration of Bachchan's legendary status in Bollywood, especially his angry young man image from the 1970s and 1980s. The film pays homage to his iconic films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar, Sholay, Don, Agneepath and others by recreating some of his famous dialogues, scenes and songs. The film also parodies the masala genre of Bollywood by using over-the-top action sequences, flamboyant costumes and exaggerated humour.
 
Bbuddah...Hoga Terra Baap was released on 1 July 2011 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. The film was praised for its entertainment value, its tribute to Bachchan and his performance. The film was also a moderate success at the box office, earning about â¹40 crore worldwide.

The title track "Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap" is a rap song sung by Amitabh Bachchan himself, along with Vishal Dadlani. The song "Go Meera Go" is a remix of Bachchan's classic song "Jumma Chumma De De" from Hum (1991). The song "Haal-E-Dil" is a romantic duet sung by Shekhar Ravjiani and Shreya Ghoshal. The song "Main Chandigarh Di Star" is a peppy item number sung by Sunidhi Chauhan and featuring Charmy Kaur.
